## About Me

My name is Ellen, and I’m originally from Guangdong, China, but Canada has been my second hometown after spending more than 10 years here. Before pursuing graduate studies, I completed a Bachelor of Commerce in Business Economics and Law at the Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta (2015–2019). After gaining some industry experience, I decided to return to school and recently completed a BA in Environment & Sustainability with a GIS Minor at the University of British Columbia’s Faculty of Arts (2022–2025). Professionally, I’ve worked as a GIS Technician co-op with the BC Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and most recently with the Partnership for Water Sustainability in BC (2025). These roles deepened my interest in spatial data analysis and sustainable land and water management. I’ve chosen to pursue the MGEM program to strengthen my technical expertise in geospatial science and contribute to evidence-based environmental policy. Long-term, I hope to work at the intersection of GIS, sustainability, and public policy, helping drive impactful decisions in resource and land management.
