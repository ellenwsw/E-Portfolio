## About Me

Hi! My name is Ellen Wu (she/her). Born and raised in China for the first 16 years of my life, I am deeply influenced by Chinese values and culture. My blended experiences in both China and Canada, along with my academic focus on business and geography, provide me with a unique perspective and valuable insights. I am a feminist with strong opinions. Outside of work and study, I am most interested in reading history.
